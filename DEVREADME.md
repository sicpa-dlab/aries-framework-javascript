# Framework Developers

This file is intended for developers working on the internals of the framework. If you're just looking how to get started with the framework, see the [docs](./docs)

## Notice on building packages

There is a common issue with building packages in forked monorepositories. See details [here](https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/cbdc-projects/blob/main/docs/devs/forked-monorepo-build.md).

## Running tests

Test are executed using jest. Some test require either the **mediator agents** or the **ledger** to be running. When running tests that require a connection to the ledger pool, you need to set the `TEST_AGENT_PUBLIC_DID_SEED` and `GENESIS_TXN_PATH` environment variables.

### Setting environment variables

If you're using the setup as described in this document, you don't need to provide any environment variables as the default will be sufficient.

- `GENESIS_TXN_PATH`: The path to the genesis transaction that allows us to connect to the indy pool.
  - `GENESIS_TXN_PATH=network/genesis/local-genesis.txn` - default. Works with the [ledger setup](#setup-ledger) from the previous step.
  - `GENESIS_TXN_PATH=network/genesis/builder-net-genesis.txn` - Sovrin BuilderNet genesis.
  - `GENESIS_TXN_PATH=/path/to/any/ledger/you/like`
- `TEST_AGENT_PUBLIC_DID_SEED`: The seed to use for the public DID. This will be used to do public write operations to the ledger. You should use a seed for a DID that is already registered on the ledger.
  - If using the local or default genesis, use the same seed you used for the `add-did-from-seed` command from the [ledger setup](#setup-ledger) in the previous step. (default is `000000000000000000000000Trustee9`)
  - If using the BuilderNet genesis, make sure your seed is registered on the BuilderNet using [selfserve.sovrin.org](https://selfserve.sovrin.org/) and you have read and accepted the associated [Transaction Author Agreement](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/TAA/TAA.md). We are not responsible for any unwanted consequences of using the BuilderNet.

### Setup Ledger

For testing we've added a setup to this repo that allows you to quickly setup an indy ledger.

```sh
# Build indy pool
docker build -f network/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy-pool . --platform linux/amd64

# NOTE: If you are on an ARM (M1) mac use the `network/indy-pool-arm.dockerfile` instead
# docker build -f network/indy-pool-arm.dockerfile -t indy-pool . --platform linux/arm64/v8

# Start indy pool
docker run -d --rm --name indy-pool -p 9701-9708:9701-9708 indy-pool

# Setup CLI. This creates a wallet, connects to the ledger and sets the Transaction Author Agreement
docker exec indy-pool indy-cli-setup

#  DID and Verkey from seed. Set 'Trustee' role in order to be able to register public DIDs
docker exec indy-pool add-did-from-seed 000000000000000000000000Trustee9 TRUSTEE

# If you want to register using the DID/Verkey you can use
# docker exec indy-pool add-did "NkGXDEPgpFGjQKMYmz6SyF" "CrSA1WbYYWLJoHm16Xw1VEeWxFvXtWjtsfEzMsjB5vDT"
```

### Run all tests

You can run the tests using the following command.

```sh
yarn test
```

If you're not using the ledger setup from above, make sure you pass the correct environment variables from [Setting environment variables](#setting-environment-variables) for connecting to the indy **ledger** pool.

```sh
GENESIS_TXN_PATH=network/genesis/local-genesis.txn TEST_AGENT_PUBLIC_DID_SEED=000000000000000000000000Trustee9 yarn test
```

## Usage with Docker

If you don't want to install the libindy dependencies yourself, or want a clean environment when running the framework or tests you can use docker.

Make sure you followed the [local ledger setup](#setup-ledger) to setup a local indy pool inside docker.

```sh
# Builds the framework docker image with all dependencies installed
docker build -t aries-framework-javascript .

# Run test with ledger pool
docker run -it --rm --network host aries-framework-javascript yarn test
```
